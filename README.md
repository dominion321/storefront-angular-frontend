# ECommerce

This is an e-commerce web application. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3. The goal here is to test out my knowledge of Angular in form of a project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Components

## Models

## Routes

- / - The Home directory. This is where users see a list of products available for purchase.

- /cart - When a user adds a product to cart, it is added here. To view the cart, you can either click on 'Cart' at the navigation bar or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/cart` to open it.

- /confirmation -  After a successful checkout, this page will appear on your screen.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
